* [The Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE)](http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vqe.html)
* [The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qaoa.html)
* [The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)](http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qft.html)

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is hosted at [http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Installation
------------

You can install Grove directly from the Python package manager `pip` using:
```
pip install quantum-grove
```

To instead install Grove from source, clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run:
```
pip install -e .
```

This will install Groveâ€™s dependencies if you do not already have them.
However, you will still need to install pyQuil and set up a connection to
the Rigetti Forest (see below).

Dependencies
------------

* NumPy
* SciPy
* NetworkX (for building and analyzing graphs)
* Matplotlib (useful for plotting)
* pytest (optional, for development testing)
* mock (optional, for development testing)

Forest and pyQuil
-----------------

Grove also requires the Python library for Quil, called
[pyQuil](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

You can install pyQuil directly from the Python package manager `pip` using:
```
pip install pyquil
```

To instead install pyQuil from source, clone the
[pyQuil GitHub repository](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil),
`cd` into it, and run:
```
pip install -e .
```

You will need to make sure that your pyQuil installation is properly
configured to run with a quantum virtual machine (QVM) or real quantum processor
(QPU) hosted on the  [Rigetti Forest](forest.rigetti.com), which requires an API key.
See the pyQuil [docs](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for
instructions on how to do this.

Building the Docs
-----------------

We use sphinx to build the documentation. To do this, navigate into Grove's top-level directory and run:

```
sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build
```

To view the docs navigate to the newly-created `docs/_build` directory and open
the `index.html` file in a browser. Note that we use the Read the Docs theme for
our documentation, so this may need to be installed using `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`.

Development and Testing
-----------------------

We use pytest for testing. Tests can be run from the top-level directory using:
```
pytest
```
