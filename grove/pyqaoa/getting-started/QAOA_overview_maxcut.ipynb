In the debue paper on QAOA (arXiv: 1411.4028), Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann demonstrate that the lowest order approximation of the algorithm produced an approximation ratio of 0.6946 for the MaxCut problem on three-regular graphs.

    "``pyQAOA`` is a python library that implements the QAOA.  It uses the `PauliTerm` and `PauliSum` objects from the pyQuil library for expressing the cost Hamiltonian and driver Hamiltonain. These operators are used to create a parametric pyQuil program and passed to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) solver in Grove.  VQE calls the Rigetti Forest QVM to exectue the Quil program that prepares the angle parameterized state.  There are multiple ways to construct the MAX-CUT problem for the QAOA library.  We include a method that accepts a graph and returns a QAOA instance where the costs and driver Hamiltonaians have been constructed.  The graph is either an undirected Networkx graph or a list of tuples where each tuple represents an edge between a pair of nodes.\n",
